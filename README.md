# ToDo list with Python and Gtk3

## Installation

1. Get python3 (tested with Python 3.5 on Linux Mint 18.3)
2. Clone the project with git.
3. Install `gtk+-3` with your OS package manager. On Mac (maybe) like this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30098892/install-gtk-3-for-python-on-mac. On Linux, it can be found from most of the distroes and package repositories.
4. Run `./main.py` or `python3 main.py` if your Python is somewhere else than `/usr/bin/python3`.
